# Smooth Scrolling and Content Reveal Website
This website was developed as part of a WebDesignMaster tutorial, demonstrating smooth scrolling and dynamic content reveal based on the user's scroll position. We utilized basic features of GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to create engaging animations and seamless user interaction.

## Features
- Smooth Scrolling: The site offers smooth, fluid scrolling, enhancing the overall browsing experience.
- Dynamic Content Reveal: Content elements fade in or appear as you scroll through different sections, adding an interactive touch.
- GSAP Animations: Using GSAP, we implemented powerful animations that are both lightweight and customizable.
## Technologies Used
- HTML5 & CSS3: For the structure and styling of the website.
- JavaScript & GSAP: To enable smooth scrolling and content animations triggered by scroll position.
## How to Use
Simply open the github-pages link in the deployments section on the right.
## Acknowledgments
Big thanks to WebDesignMaster for providing a thorough and insightful tutorial, as well as to GSAP for the incredible animation tools.
